# S.W.A.G. - Super Wild Assault Game
## Jacob Smilg and Melissa Kazazic
## Summary

S.W.A.G. is a simple, customizable platform fighter engine. Two players are spawned in at the start of the game, and they fight until one player's health bar is reduced to zero. The main inspiration for the customization is M.U.G.E.N. â€” it is designed such that new characters can be added with relative ease. Two existing characters, Olin Man and Catboy, are included as playable examples. More information on character customization can be found on the [website](https://olincollege.github.io/super-wild-assault-game/).
